# Death Clock
This is a little app to calculate the exact\* amount of time you have left to live based on the Social Security Administration's [actuarial life tables](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html). It uses Local Storage to remember the time left when you close your window. Hit the "Reset Clock" button to reset the clock.

\**And by 'exact' I mean 'approximate'.*
